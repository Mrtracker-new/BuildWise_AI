/**
 * LandingPage.tsx — the BuildWise AI marketing page.
 * Composition: Navbar → Hero → FeatureStrip → StandardsSection → CtaBand →
 * Footer. The order is the nav's order, top to bottom, so the scroll-spy can
 * derive the current section from document position alone. Owns the landing
 * route's chrome: unlocks body scroll (the app shell needs overflow-hidden),
 * boots Lenis smooth scrolling, and manages the document title.
 *
 * THE ONE THING DRAWN BELOW THE HERO'S COPY LIVES INSIDE THE HERO (`HeroModel.tsx`),
 * not between it and the capabilities: the composition is still nav → hero →
 * capabilities → standards → closing band, and the model is the hero's own second
 * beat rather than a section of its own.
 *
 * THERE IS NO PRODUCT-PREVIEW SECTION BETWEEN THE HERO AND THE CAPABILITIES.
 * Six attempts lived there — a hand-built mock-up of the app, screenshots of it, the
 * engine's own drawing sheets, a clean sheet re-drawn from the engine's geometry, a
 * figures panel, and a scroll-scrubbed build-up of that geometry — and every one was
 * removed. They were parked for a while under `frontend/quarantine/`, which has since
 * been deleted too, so nothing of them is left in the tree: no section id (`#platform`
 * is gone, and the hero's "See the platform" button now lands on `#capabilities`), no
 * components, no public assets, no CSS. The capture that fed them is unchanged and
 * still reproducible — see `backend/scripts/capture_landing_generation.py`.
