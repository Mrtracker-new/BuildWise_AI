/**
 * Backdrop.tsx — the landing's ambient page layer.
 * A fixed, pointer-transparent backdrop that turns the empty gutters at
 * wide viewports into part of the composition: a faint architectural
 * blueprint grid, accent glows echoing the palette, a giant outline
 * compass rose, and surveyor-style coordinate annotations. Sections
 * render transparent above it; the hero's photo sits opaque on top.
 *
 * WHY IT MOVES, AND BY SO LITTLE. A fixed layer is the cheapest depth cue a
 * page has: it is already painted and already outside the document flow, so
 * translating it is one composite per frame instead of a repaint. What the eye
 * reads as distance is not the motion itself but the DIFFERENCE between layers
 * — so each one takes a different fraction of the scroll (`useDrift`), from the
 * blueprint grid, which is the paper the page is printed on and barely moves,
 * to the coordinate annotations, which sit nearest the reader's plane.
 *
 * The fractions are small on purpose (3–18% of the scroll), and NEGATIVE: the
 * page's content travels up at 100% of the scroll, so a layer that travels up
 * at 5% is the one that looks distant. At the 40–60% a full parallax would use,
 * these elements cross most of the viewport over one screen of scrolling and
 * the page reads as a diorama sliding behind glass; at these values the gutters
 * acquire depth and nothing asks to be looked at.
 *
 * The instruments turn. The compass rose and its smaller counter-dial are the
 * one pair here whose motion is not a depth cue — they are there so the
 * composition is not four parallel translations, which is the thing that reads
 * as a template. Both are driven by PAGE PROGRESS, not by a fixed 3200px
 * offset, so the turn spans the whole document: the rose has come half round by
 * the time the reader reaches the closing band, and the dial on the other
 * gutter has gone the other way. A rotation bound to raw scroll distance stops
 * meaning anything the moment the page grows or shrinks; progress cannot.
 *
 * THE INSTRUMENTS HAVE WEIGHT. The turn is handed the same damped follow the
 * hero and standards dials use (`useDampedFollow`), at the same `tau`, so the
 * three instruments on the page settle at one rate and the page has ONE weight
 * rather than a section-sized one in the copy and a scrollbar-sized one in the
 * gutters. Bound raw, these two were the only dials on the page that stopped
 * dead with the wheel — and they are the largest moving shapes here, so a fling
 * snapped a 420px rose a full half turn in the frames the wheel was moving.
 * Now they trail it and come to rest a fraction of a second after it does. The
 * parking behaviour in that hook is what makes this affordable on a fixed
 * layer: with no `IntersectionObserver` to gate it, the loop sleeps when the
 * value has settled and wakes on the next scroll change.
 *
 * Reduced motion: this is not gated. Motion that follows the reader's own
 * scrolling is position, not animation — it cannot play unbidden, it stops the
 * instant they do, and it is the same feedback the progress rail gives. The
 * ambient LOOPS on this page (the mist veil, the needle) are still killed by the
 * CSS media query in index.css, and they are the part that genuinely loops.

     the section edges on the way down and the rose is somewhere else when the
     reader comes back up.

     The mapping comes first and the follow second, so the damped value is in
     DEGREES and its settle threshold is measured against the sweep. Following
     the progress instead would be the same picture at this range, but it would
     put the instrument's weight on a 0→1 value that no consumer of the angle

      {/* OVERSIZED IN VIEWPORT UNITS, NOT PERCENTAGES. The layer drifts up as the
          page scrolls, so its edges have to stay outside the viewport for the
          whole document — a grid that ran out of grid leaves a bare strip under
          the nav. This was `inset-[-30%]`, and that was the landing's only
          measurable layout shift: the page paints one screen tall (the boot
          shell) and grows to ~3 300px when React fills it in, so the classic
          scrollbar arrives AFTER first paint and takes 15px off the layout width.
          A percentage inset is resolved against the containing block, so the
          whole layer resized with it — Lighthouse's desktop run caught this one
          node moving for CLS 0.011. `vw`/`vh` are fixed for a given window and do
          not move when the scrollbar appears, so the geometry is now independent
          of that change. (On overlay-scrollbar systems — macOS by default — the
          shift never happened, which is why five puppeteer viewports and the
          mobile Lighthouse run all read 0.000.) */}
