/**
 * HeroModel.tsx — the landing's set piece: the captured plot, extruded.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS, AND WHY IT IS ALLOWED TO EXIST. Two 3D heroes were built on this
 * page before and both were removed (see Hero.tsx): a WebGL massing that implied a
 * viewer the product does not ship, and a scroll-driven corridor of engine sheets
 * that spent three viewports of the reader's attention on itself. This is the third,
 * and it is different in the two ways those failed:
 *
 *  1. It is TRANSFORM-ONLY. No canvas, no GPU library, no renderer, no authored
 *     mesh: every storey is a `div` stood up with `rotateX(-90deg)`, lit by its own
 *     bearing, and every opening on it is an engine-returned window placement
 *     (`floors[].windows` in heroMassing.ts). It therefore has no no-WebGL rung to
 *     fall to, and the reduced-motion rung is the same composition settled rather
 *     than a different picture.
 *  2. It is ONE screen, and it is scrubbed by the reader's own scroll with no
 *     pinning and no runway. The ground floor and the site are always drawn; the
 *     first storey rises and the roof lands on it as the window comes up to the
 *     reading line, and the drawing's dimension chains arrive last. Nothing is
 *     held on screen and nothing is invented: the caption below prints the
 *     generation id, the certificate the engine returned, and where the geometry
 *     came from.
 *
 * WHY IT LOOKS LIKE A BUILDING RATHER THAN FOUR BLOCKS. A massing drawn as one flat
 * tone per face is exactly what a stack of boxes looks like — measured on the first
 * build of this file, where the whole volume sat between RGB 214 and 249 against a
 * white sheet and read as a pale lid on two bands. What makes a model read as
 * architecture is everything BETWEEN the corners:
 *
 *  · FOUR VALUES, NOT TWO. Each face is lit by its own outward normal against one
 *    light direction (see `shadeOf`), so the lit east elevation and the shaded south
 *    one separate at the corner without an outline being drawn anywhere.
 *  · A SLAB BAND WITH A REAL CAST SHADOW. The band is at the engine's own
 *    floor-to-floor line; the shadow under it is what makes two storeys read as
 *    two, and it is why the band is drawn as a gradient rather than a stripe.
 *  · A PLINTH. The bottom 0.14 m of the ground floor is a darker base course, the
 *    one convention that stops a wall meeting the ground in a hard line.
 *  · REVEALED OPENINGS. The engine's window schedule gives a sill, a head and a
 *    span, and the renderer uses all three: a recessed reveal with a shadowed head,
 *    a light frame, glazing with a sky reflection, a mullion pattern by width, and
 *    a projecting sill that throws its own line. A dark rectangle painted on a wall
 *    is a hole; a window with a reveal is an opening.
 *  · PANEL JOINTS. Fine vertical joints at 1.35 m give a 13.5 m wall a scale. This
 *    is TEXTURE, not a capture field, and is the only wall pattern here that is not
 *    derived from the generation (the roof paving is the same kind of texture).
 *
 * THE POSE WAS CHOSEN BY LOOKING AT THE RESULT. The first version of the third hero
 * was pitched 50° and yawed −22°, which put one elevation across most of the sheet
 * and turned the other — where seven of the twelve openings are — into a sliver. The
 * pose is now 45° / −38°, and the rotations were also corrected rather than just
 * retuned: `rotateY` on a flat sheet ROLLS it out of the page instead of turning the
 * plan, which is why the east elevation measured 70 px against the south's 437. A
 * `rotateZ` first turns the plan within its own plane and the pitch then tilts it,
 * so both visible elevations arrive at their true foreshortened widths. See the
 * pose write in `HeroModel` for the measurement.
 *
 * THE SCRUB IS P4'S FIRST REAL CONSUMER, and it is why this file exists at all.
 * `useDampedScrub` had unit coverage and no landing section to prove it on; the
 * acceptance items it could not be measured against (settled end under reduced
 * motion, a monotone value across a real scroll) are now asserted in a browser
 * against this element — see `scripts/interaction_probe.cjs` [7], which reads the
 * ROOF's projected position, not an internal value, so what it measures is the
 * drawing rather than a mirror of the state that drew it.
 *
 * THE SUB-BANDS END BEFORE THE BAND DOES, on purpose: the rise completes at 60 %
 * of the entry band and the annotation at 86 %, so the settled frame is reached
 * with scroll still left. That is what lets the reduced-motion frame and the
 * animated page's end state be compared as pixels rather than as intent.

 * a stripe under it, which is exactly the "stack of blocks" reading.
 *

 * (the roof takes over half the model and the facades are a band); at 45° the two
 * elevations carry the drawing and the terrace is still legible inside its parapet.
 * Below ~32° a 1.2 m window head is only a few pixels of reveal, and above ~55° the

 * windows on it; −38° brings the east elevation up to 9 m × sin 38° ≈ 5.5 m of
