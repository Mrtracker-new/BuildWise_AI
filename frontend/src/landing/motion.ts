/**
 * landing/motion.ts — shared motion vocabulary for the landing page.
 * Apple-style curves only: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1) for timed
 * transitions, stiff/soft damped springs for interactive motion.
 * Every variant respects prefers-reduced-motion via `fadeOnly`.
 *
 * REVEAL BUDGET. A marketing page is read, not watched, and the old reveals
 * spent it: section content faded in over 900ms and the hero's headline mask
 * took 1050ms, so the first useful pixels of every section arrived a second
 * after it entered the viewport and scrolling faster than the animation meant
 * reading half-revealed copy. Everything now lands inside ~600ms, and the
 * hero's own entrance happens once, on load, before the reader can scroll.
 *
 * WHEN a reveal fires matters as much as how long it lasts, and that turned out
 * to be the real defect (see SETTLE_VIEWPORT): the reveals were firing at the
 * bottom edge of the screen, so they finished before the content was anywhere
 * near the reading position, and the page read as static with stray motion
 * happening behind the reader. Below-fold content now becomes visible ONCE, at
 * the reading line — which is also why none of it is scrubbed by the wheel:
 * text whose opacity tracks the scroll can be caught half-legible mid-scroll.
 * The scroll-linked half of this page's motion lives in scrollLink.ts (depth,
 * the product window, the map's analysis, the progress rail) and is
 * transform-only, on layers that were already composited.
