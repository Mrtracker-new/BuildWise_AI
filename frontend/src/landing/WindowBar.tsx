/**
 * WindowBar.tsx — a macOS window title bar.
 *
 * This is the landing's "this is a real Mac app" cue, and it is deliberately
 * structural rather than decorative:
 *  - The three lights are GREY at rest and gain their colours while the pointer
 *    is over the window (see `.bw-window:hover .bw-traffic` in index.css), which
 *    is what an unfocused window actually looks like on macOS. On touch devices
 *    the media query hands them their colour immediately.
 *  - The document title is centred and truncates, exactly like a real title bar,
 *    so a long site name degrades the way the OS degrades it.
 *  - The toolbar slot on the right is where the artefact states what it is.
