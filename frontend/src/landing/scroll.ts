/**
 * landing/scroll.ts — Lenis smooth scrolling for the landing route.
 * A single instance is created when the landing mounts (and destroyed on
 * unmount). Disabled entirely under prefers-reduced-motion.
 *
 * TUNING NOTE. This used to run on a 1.1s duration curve, which is the wrong
 * control for the input it is smoothing: a duration-based tween has to finish
 * its whole animation before the next wheel event can retarget it, so on a
 * trackpad — where every event is small and continuous — the page lagged the
 * fingers by a fixed slice of a second no matter how small the gesture was.
 * `lerp` (a fixed fraction of the remaining distance per frame) instead tracks
 * the pointer's own speed: small gestures move a little, big ones glide, and
 * the value approaches the target without ever spending a fixed second doing
 * it. 0.12 is the usual "still smooths, no longer feels detached" setting.
 *
 * Anchor jumps keep an explicit duration (an eased 0.9s travel), because those
 * ARE a single discrete gesture where a tween is the right shape.
