/**
 * landing/heroCopy.ts — the hero's first screen, as data.
 *
 * ONE SOURCE, TWO RENDERERS. The strings below are rendered twice: by React in
 * Hero.tsx once the landing route has mounted, and by the BUILD, into
 * index.html as a static shell (the `bw-landing-boot` plugin in vite.config.ts).
 * They live here rather than inline in the JSX so the two renderers cannot drift
 * — a headline edited in one place and not the other would show as a visible
 * text change the moment React replaced the shell.
 *
 * WHY A STATIC SHELL EXISTS AT ALL. The landing is a client-rendered SPA, so
 * nothing in it can paint until ~142 KB gz of JavaScript has been downloaded,
 * parsed, evaluated and rendered. Measured on the mobile preset: FCP 1.7 s, and
 * an LCP of 4.2 s whose breakdown was TTFB 453 ms + **render delay 3 820 ms
 * (89 %)**. The largest paint on the first screen was waiting on the bundle.
 * The shell is the first screen shipped as HTML, so it paints with the document
 * and React adopts the page underneath it; the plugin hides the shell the moment
 * #root has children, and until then it is the hero.
 *
 * WHAT THE SHELL IS NOT. It is not a second design. `firstScreenCss()` is
 * generated from the same tokens Hero.tsx uses, so the two paints are the same
 * pixels; the shell is absolutely positioned and out of flow, so its removal
 * cannot shift anything (CLS stays a property of the reserved boxes). And it
 * carries no focusable nodes, so it cannot add a tab stop.
 *
 * HIDDEN BY DEFAULT, REVEALED BY ROUTE. index.html is one document serving both
 * `/` and `/app`, so the shell is in the HTML for both — which means the default
 * state has to be `display: none` and the LANDING route has to be what turns it
 * on. The alternative (visible by default, hidden on the landing) would have put
 * a marketing hero on top of the application for every /app visitor. The switch
 * is the `bw-boot-landing` class the boot script adds to <html> in the head, on
 * `/` only, before anything paints.

   React has committed a child, so the shell leaves in the SAME style
   recalculation the real hero arrives in — one paint, no frame where both exist,
   and nothing to fail.

   The first version did this from a MutationObserver in a head script, and it
   never fired: that script ran while the document was still in the head, so the
   shell element it looked for did not exist yet, the whole block was skipped,
   and the shell stayed visible UNDER the real hero for the life of the page —
   a duplicated headline, found by the evidence harness rather than by looking at
   it. :has() is the mechanism now (Chrome 105+, Safari 15.4+, Firefox 121+);
   the boot script keeps an observer as a fallback for engines without it.

   visibility, not display, so the element is never removed: an LCP candidate
   that leaves the DOM invalidates the paint it already earned. */

   and does exist a moment later — which takes 15px off the layout width and
   slides every centred column left by half of it. Lighthouse's desktop run
   measured that as the landing's only layout shift (CLS 0.011, attributed to the
   hero's own container), and it is invisible to any test run on a platform with
   overlay scrollbars, which is why five puppeteer viewports and the mobile
