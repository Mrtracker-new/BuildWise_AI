/**
 * ArrivalSlice.tsx — mount an ARRIVING section on an idle slice.
 * ==============================================================
 * When a generated plan lands in an open report sheet, everything that appears
 * with it used to commit in one task: the certificate panel and its QA rows, the
 * plan's schedules, on top of a full re-render of the sheet. At 4× that arrival
 * is the only surface still over the 25 ms script budget (80.2 ms `MessagePort`
 * — React rendering the whole arrival in one go).
 *
 * A slice defers ONE section's first render to the next idle moment. Two rules
 * make that safe inside a report the reader is looking at:
 *
 *   • SAME-HEIGHT PLACEHOLDER. A slice that changes the height of what is above
 *     it is a layout shift with extra steps, and CLS is measured across this
 *     mount. So the placeholder reserves the height this slice measured the last
 *     time it mounted (a module-level cache keyed by slice id); the first-ever
 *     mount falls back to the caller's estimate and the real height is recorded
 *     for every arrival after it.
 *
 *   • NO PLACEHOLDER FOR CONTENT THAT IS ALREADY THERE. `isArrival` is the
 *     caller's own "this data turned up while the reader was looking at the
 *     section" signal (ReportSheet tracks the plan key it has already shown). A
 *     tab visit, a reopened sheet or a regenerate renders the finished section
 *     immediately: the slice is for arrivals, not for tab visits, which
 *     `useDeferredValue(panelTab)` already transitions.
 *
 * The reveal itself is a transition, so an interaction that lands in the same
 * idle window (a tab click, a floor switch) still wins over mounting a card.
