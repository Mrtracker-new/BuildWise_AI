Road service — shared Overpass nearest-road capability.
================================================================
Extracted from vastu_service: the Overpass query, cache,
rate-limit, and honest offline fallback now live in ONE place so both the
vastu advisory and the public /api/nearest-road proxy consume the same
implementation.

Policy compliance (mirrors geocode_service):
- Overpass API: server-side <=1 req/s throttle, identifying User-Agent, and a
  timeout budget ordered so the SERVER gives up before the client does.
  Ref: https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/overpass/ (be
  nice: cache aggressively; this service answers from cache when possible).
- Results cached in the 24h hazard cache keyed on a rounded coordinate grid
  (category/precision chosen by the caller).
- AMENDMENT 1 (no fabricated geometry): when Overpass is unreachable or
  returns nothing usable, the fallback NEVER synthesizes a bearing. It
  returns is_fallback=True, bearing_degrees=None, approach_side='unknown'
  and provenance annotation 'ASSUMED' with a user-facing warning.
- Attribution: OpenStreetMap contributors (ODbL), via Overpass API.

Timeout budget (regression pin — see _ATTEMPT_READ_TIMEOUT_S ordering):
the previous client timeout (3.5 s, equal to the query's own `[timeout:4]`)
was SHORTER than a normal Overpass answer, so every lookup aborted
client-side and degraded to ASSUMED even while Overpass was healthy. The
budget below keeps `QL_TIMEOUT < client read timeout` (the server answers
with its own 504 instead of the client timing out blind) and caps the whole
lookup with a wall-clock deadline so a slow upstream cannot stall the
frontage step indefinitely.
