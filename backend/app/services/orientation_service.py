    Computes passive solar building orientation and aerodynamic ventilation axis.
    
    Principles:
    1. Solar Control: Long facades should ideally orient North-South (axis East-West at 90 deg)
       to minimize direct low-angle solar heat gain from East and West facades.
    2. Aerodynamic Cross-Ventilation: Windows and primary apertures should capture prevailing wind
       at an incident angle between 45 and 90 degrees.
    3. Deflection: A minor skew (+/- 15 deg) from pure East-West is applied depending on the wind vector.
