"""Scheme picker wiring gate: the picker must re-solve, the panel must print the certificate.

Static source assertions for the picker and panel surfaces. They exist because both
failures are invisible at runtime: a picker that only sets a label still renders,
and a land-economics panel that recomputes its own KPIs still looks right.
