test_invariant_sweep_standing.py - the adversarial sweep as a STANDING harness
==============================================================================
``scripts/qa_invariant_sweep.py`` runs the full 28-case adversarial matrix; that is
too slow for every test run. This module keeps the sweep wired into the suite by
re-running two pinned reproductions through the REAL sweep code:

  * T1-tiny-8x10 (seed 1003) - the refusal repro. It previously produced four
    "violations" (no land report, no gate, no certificate, no T1 programme)
    against a generation that had correctly refused the brief. The refusal now
    carries a full L1-L15 FAIL gate, and the sweep judges it on
    refusal-honesty (I10) instead of on rooms it never drew.
  * T1-rect-20x20 (seed 1002) - a solved plate that used to violate
    I5-SCHEDULE-AREA-FIELD and I5-SVG-SCHEDULE-TRUNCATED. Both must stay closed:
    the schedule publishes gross/clear areas separately and the sheet prints
    every room.

Run the full matrix with:
    python scripts/qa_invariant_sweep.py --quick
