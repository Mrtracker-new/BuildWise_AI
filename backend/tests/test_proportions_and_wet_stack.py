"""Room proportion in the band solver, and wet-stack honesty.

Contracts for room proportions and wet-stack alignment:

* room aspect ratios were only *scored*, never solved for, so a 23 m wide band
  produced 1:4.8 bedrooms and 47 m² bathrooms;
* cross-floor wet alignment relied on every storey having the same programme,
  while ``VERT-01-WET-STACK-ALIGN`` was stamped on every wet room regardless.

These tests pin the solver-side answers: frontage is allocated up to each
space's catalogue proportion, a band is split so its rooms can fill it, and a
wet room only claims VERT-01 when it measurably sits over one below.
