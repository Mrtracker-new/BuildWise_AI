"""A multi-wing plate must carry the REQUESTED typology's programme.

The multi-wing partitioner used to draw the T1 residence on every typology, so
a T2 plate came back with living/kitchen/master_bed, a T3 plate with no office
cell and a T4 plate with no bay.  The product the user asked for was silently
swapped for a house.  These pins run the real entry point on an L-shaped plate
and judge the drawn programme's ontology types against the typology catalogue.

A refusal is allowed (an L-wing cannot always host a warehouse) but it must be a
named refusal - gate FAIL, deficit/UNFIT warning - never a T1 drawing.
